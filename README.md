## Description of Features

### Crawler

The crawler is an extension of the crawl task from HW2. The crawler follows the Mercator model and distributes the tasks involved in the crawl. Added are a worker and master Spark Java servers along with changes to the queue and other aspects of the crawler to increase efficiency.

### Indexer
The indexer takes documents and creates an inverted index which maps terms to documents that contain them, along a seond table that maps terms to their IDFs. 

### PageRank

The PageRank algorithm is written in Python on a Jupyter Notebook using PySpark SQL. It queries a Postgres AWS RDS instance for graph edge list
data and loads it into a spark dataframe for computation. When it converges the results are written back to RDS.

### Query and Search

The query function returns a sorted list of documents matching a user's query, where documents' scores are a combination of TF-IDF, pagerank, and several custom bonuses we implemented. On the front-end, there is a web server API for the query function and a React-based UI to display search results.

## How to Run The Project

### Crawler

The crawler can be run using Maven. Within the `pom.xml` file, there are different executions for the master node and up to 3 worker nodes.
To run the master, just simply run `mvn exec:java@master` and to run the workers, run `mvn exec:java@worker[number]`.
It is important to note that there are several environment variables that the crawler uses. These are `RDS_USERNAME`, `RDS_PASSWORD`,
and `RDS_HOSTNAME`. These must be filled in for the crawler to access and write to the database. Additionally,
when using EC2, you will have to change the argument in `pom.xml` to match what ever location the master node is running on.

### Indexer
To run the indexer, first run `mvn package` within the 555-indexer directory, which will create a JAR file in the target folder. Upload this file to S3, and create an EMR cluster that runs this S3 file as a "Spark step." Make sure that the arguments for spark-submit contains ``--class edu.upenn.cis.cis455.invertedindex.Indexer`` and that you specify ``--conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.RDS_USERNAME=___ --conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.RDS_PASSWORD=___ --conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.RDS_HOSTNAME=___``. The arguments to the main class itself is of the form ``crawlerDocsTableName invertedIndexTableName idfsTablename numPartitions``, where ``numPartitions`` specifies the number of partitions Spark uses throughout the job. 

### PageRank

Follow this tutorial to configure and launch your EC2 node: https://chrisalbon.com/aws/basics/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/ . Afterwards,
upload the 2 notebooks: pagerank.ipynb and clean_urls.ipynb using the Jupyter Notebook UI. Additionally add the postgresql-42.2.20.jar file in
the same directory. You will also need the create a file called aws_credentials.json and put it into the same directory. The file should have the
following format:
{
"aws_access_key_id": "",
"aws_secret_access_key": "",
"password": "",
"ENDPOINT": "",
"PORT": "",
"USR": "",
"REGION": "",
"DBNAME": ""
}

Now just run clean_urls.ipynb, then run pagerank.ipynb.

### Document Title/Preview Extractor

Deploy on EMR by setting a stage and uploading the jar with dependencies to Amazon S3.

### Query and Search

Every other component can be deployed in EC2.
In particular, we can deploy the web server and the UI on the same EC2 node,
with the web server running on port 45555 and the UI running on port 80.
